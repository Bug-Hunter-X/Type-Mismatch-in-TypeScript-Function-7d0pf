This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript: passing arguments of the wrong type to a function.

The `bug.ts` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in a compilation error.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides the corrected code with proper type handling.

This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript. By catching these errors during development, we prevent runtime issues and improve code reliability.
